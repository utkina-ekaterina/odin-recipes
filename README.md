# odin-recipes

## Introduction
This is **Recipes project** that was done within the *Foundations* course on *https://www.theodinproject.com/*.

## Implementation
In this project I have used **HTML and CSS** based on the course material and directions.

I am still modifying this project.

## Description
The idea is to display various recipes on the website. The main page includes all the available recipes on the website. After the user clicks on the recipe name on the main page, the user is being transferred on the page with the recipe. On that page the user is able to see ingredients that are needed for this meal, the amount of time that is needed to prepare the dish, and the preparation steps.

## References
All recipes and photos of meals are taken from *https://www.allrecipes.com/*.

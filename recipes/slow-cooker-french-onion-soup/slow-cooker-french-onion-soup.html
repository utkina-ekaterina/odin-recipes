    <h1 class="titles">Slow Cooker French Onion Soup</h1>
    <p class="description">Here is the <strong><i>Slow cooker French onion soup</i></strong> for <strong><i>8 servings</i></strong>. 
        This slow cooker French onion soup is ridiculously easy to make, mainly since it cooks in a 
        slow cooker! After it's been simmering all day, you come home to an amazing aroma and a 
        fabulous meal for a cold winter day. You do not have to caramelize the onions; you can melt 
        the butter in your crockpot, stir in the onions to coat, add the remaining ingredients, and cook. 
        However, caramelizing the onions makes for a much, much better soup! </p>

    <h3 class="titles">Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
       <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>4 large yellow onions, sliced and separated into rings</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ cup cooking sherry</li>
            <li>7 cups reduced-sodium beef broth</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>8 slices of French bread</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
            <li>⅓ cup shredded Emmental cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
       </ul></p>

        <h3 class="titles">Directions</h3>
        <ol>
        <li><h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>Heat butter in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add onions; cook and stir until translucent, 
            about 10 minutes. Sprinkle onions with sugar; reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring constantly, until 
            onions are soft and caramelized, at least 30 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</p>
        </li>

        <li><h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Stir sherry into onion mixture; scrape the bottom to dissolve the small bits of browned food. Transfer onions 
            into a slow cooker and pour in beef broth. Season with sea salt; stir in thyme and bay leaf. Cover and cook on 
            Low for 8 to 10 hours or on High for 4 to 6 hours.</p>
        </li>

        <li><h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>Preheat the oven broiler about 10 minutes before serving. Set an oven rack about 8 inches from the heat source.</p>
        </li>

        <li><h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>Arrange bread slices on a baking sheet; broil until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes per side.</p>
        </li>

        <li><h4>Step 5</h4>
            <p>Lightly toss Gruyere, Emmental, Parmesan, and mozzarella cheeses in a bowl. Fill oven-safe soup crocks 3/4 full with 
            onion soup and float a bread slice in each bowl. Top each with about 2 tablespoons cheese mixture.</p>
        </li>

        <li><h4>Step 6</h4>
            <p>Place filled bowls onto a baking sheet and broil until cheese topping is lightly browned and bubbling, about 2 minutes.</p>
        </li>

        </ol>

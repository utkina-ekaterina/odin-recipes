        <h3 class="titles">Directions</h3>
        <ol>
        <li><h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Whisk together oyster sauce, soy sauce, mirin, rice vinegar, Worcestershire, sesame oil, sugar, 
        Sriracha, and garlic in a small bowl; set aside. Remove root ends from scallions and discard. 
        Chop whites and light greens into 2-inch pieces and quarter pieces lengthwise; set aside. 
        Thinly slice remaining dark greens of scallions and reserve for garnish.</p>
        </li>

        <li><h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, 
        until browned on first side, about 3 minutes. Stir and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms 
        are tender and golden brown on both sides, about 4 more minutes. Add bok choy, carrots, sliced whites and light 
        greens of scallions, and 1/4 cup water to pan with mushrooms. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are 
        just tender, about 3 minutes.</p>
        </li>

        <li><h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Add udon noodles and remaining 1/4 cup water and cook, gently separating noodles with tongs or spoon. Add reserved 
        oyster sauce mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until noodles and vegetables are well-coated, about 1 minute. 
        Divide among serving bowls and garnish with reserved sliced greens of scallions and optional garnishes. Serve immediately.</p>
        </li>
